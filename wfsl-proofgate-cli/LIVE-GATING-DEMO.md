\# Live Decision Gating Demonstration



\## Overview

This document demonstrates how \*\*WFSL ProofGate\*\* makes deterministic

decisions based on live diagnostic evidence produced by upstream WFSL tools.



The demonstration was conducted in-house under real network convergence

conditions, including transient degradation and recovery.



---



\## Evidence Inputs



ProofGate consumed evidence generated by:



\- \*\*wfsl-route-sentinel\*\*

&nbsp; - Network route quality classification

\- \*\*wfsl-evidence-guard\*\*

&nbsp; - Timestamped capture of live diagnostic state



Evidence reflected both \*\*DEGRADED\*\* and \*\*HEALTHY\*\* conditions at different times.

\## Decision Logic



ProofGate applies simple, explicit rules:



\- `HEALTHY` → `PASS`

\- `DEGRADED` → `DEGRADED\_BUT\_PROCEEDABLE`

\- `BROKEN` → `BLOCKED`



No inference, scoring, or heuristics are applied.

\## Observed Behaviour



During live testing:



\- ProofGate returned `DEGRADED\_BUT\_PROCEEDABLE` during upstream congestion

\- ProofGate returned `PASS` once conditions stabilised

\- No false `BLOCKED` states were produced

\- Decisions reflected current evidence, not historical state



---



\## Engineering Outcome



\- ProofGate behaved deterministically

\- No oscillation or panic blocking occurred

\- Decisions were repeatable and auditable

\- Behaviour matched telecom operational expectations



---



\## Status



This confirms \*\*WFSL ProofGate\*\* as an in-house tested, policy-grade

decision gate suitable for real-world telecom environments.
