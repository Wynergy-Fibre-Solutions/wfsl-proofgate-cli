\# WFSL ProofGate CLI



Deterministic proof generation and verification command-line interface for WFSL systems.



WFSL ProofGate CLI provides controlled tooling for generating, sealing, and validating proof artefacts used across WFSL governance, verification, and audit workflows.



All operations are deterministic and produce machine-verifiable outputs suitable for automated inspection.



\## Capabilities

\- Proof artefact generation

\- Deterministic sealing and hashing

\- Verification of WFSL evidence and proofs

\- Structured output for audit pipelines

\- Integration with WFSL governance and verification layers



\## Scope

WFSL ProofGate CLI operates strictly as a proof interaction interface.

It does not define policy, enforcement rules, or business logic.



This component executes declared workflows and emits verifiable artefacts only.



\## Intended users

\- WFSL core systems

\- Licensed WFSL services

\- Internal audit, verification, and governance pipelines



This component is not intended for end users or standalone commercial deployment without WFSL context.



\## Licence tier

WFSL-PAID



This repository forms part of WFSL’s licensed proof and verification infrastructure.

Commercial use requires an appropriate WFSL licence.
