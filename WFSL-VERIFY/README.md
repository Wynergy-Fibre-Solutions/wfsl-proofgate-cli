\# WFSL Verify



\## Purpose



WFSL Verify provides independent verification of WFSL evidence and trust outputs.



It allows any party to validate cryptographic integrity, evidence consistency, and declared outcomes without reliance on WFSL infrastructure.



WFSL Verify exists to support transparency, inspection, and independent assurance.



---



\## Functional Guarantees



WFSL Verify provides:



\- Independent evidence verification

\- Deterministic verification results

\- Cryptographic signature checking

\- Clear pass or fail outcomes



Verification does not modify evidence or systems.



---



\## What This Component Does Not Do



WFSL Verify explicitly does not:



\- Generate evidence

\- Make trust claims

\- Enforce policy

\- Modify artefacts

\- Require online services



It verifies only.



---



\## Verification Scope



WFSL Verify may validate:



\- Evidence hashes

\- Cryptographic signatures

\- Structural integrity

\- Declared outcomes



Verification results are reproducible by any party using the same inputs.



---



\## Role in the WFSL Platform



WFSL Verify occupies an independent verification tier within the WFSL platform.



It is used by:
